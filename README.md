# hotelDatabase
MySQL database project

considering a ficticous hotel, I have written 3 sql scripts.

1)Creates the database to the 3rd normal form.

2)Adds the data, reading from a csv file.

3)The third writes a selection of queries that represent all the key concepts of writing queries including
multi-table joins, complex boolean where statements and aggregate functions.
